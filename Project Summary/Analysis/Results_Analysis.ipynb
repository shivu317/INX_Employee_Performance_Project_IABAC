    "## Department-wise Performance Analysis\n",
    "- The analysis indicates that R&D and Sales departments show significant variation in performance ratings.\n",
    "- These departments have a higher proportion of low and high performers, indicating inconsistency.\n",
    "- HR and Support departments show relatively stable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Factors Affecting Employee Performance\n",
    "Based on feature importance and correlation analysis, the top three factors influencing employee performance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Job Satisfaction**\n",
    "   - Employees with higher job satisfaction consistently show higher performance ratings.\n",
    "   - This is the most influential factor across all departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monthly Income**\n",
    "   - Higher compensation levels are positively correlated with better performance.\n",
    "   - Indicates motivation and role seniority influence performance outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Work-Life Balance**\n",
    "   - Employees with balanced work schedules perform better and show less variability.\n",
    "   - Poor work-life balance is associated with lower performance ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Insights\n",
    "- Employees with **3–8 years of experience** at the company perform better than freshers or very senior employees.\n",
    "- Training programs positively impact mid-level employees.\n",
    "- Attrition-prone employees tend to show lower performance before exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most Important Technique Used\n",
    "- **Random Forest Classifier** was the most effective technique due to:\n",
    "  - Ability to handle feature interactions\n",
    "  - Robustness to noise\n",
    "  - Higher accuracy compared to linear models\n"
